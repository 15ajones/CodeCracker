# CodeCracker - FPGA/Arduino IOT system with complete UI

Developed by Rohan Gandhi, Anthony Jones, Sherif Agbabiaka, Omar Zeidan, Maia Ramambaison, Luca Fenocchi

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the Information Processing module in Y2. The main purpose of this project is a gaming platform which allows multiple games to be played on a website, all controlled from an FPGA. 

The modules contain relevant code to send accelerometer based messages from an Intel Altera DE10-Lite FPGA to an Arduino. This is processed by the Arduino which sends messages to a server to process this data and in turn control the UI on a website.
